    TechCavern is an organization founded and maintained by Julian Zhou (JZTech101). We were originally a Technology blog, but now we are simply an organization dedicated to working on
  free and open source projects. Our motto remains because that is what our chatrooms are typically discussing. Anything and everything we make will be under the MIT License. Forked projects will be relicensed to MIT when possible. But 99% of the time, it will remain with the original license.
