<p> TechCavern started out as a blog by Julian Zhou (JZTech101). Its original purpose was to provide dedicated news and reviews to geeks around the world. However, it wasn't long before school took over his life. Soon enough, the resources for the website collapsed and it was shutdown. What you are seeing are the remants of the website. TechCavern is no longer the blog it once was. It is instead a community. A community of geeks from around the globe. Gamers or otherwise </p>
