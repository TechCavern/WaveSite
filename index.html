  <paper-material><h3>You will not find your passion in things and you will not find your passion in money. The more things and the more money you have, the more you will look around and use that as the metric and there will be someone with more. <i> -Randy Pausch, Carnegie Mellon Commencement Speech, 2008</i></h3>
    <paper-material><h3>Do not waste your time in this world pursuing things that you will inevitably lose when you die. Instead, use the time you have to pursue the one thing that will stay with you through death to the afterlife, love. Love can take many forms and the more of it you have, the happier you will be.<i> -Julian Zhou, 2016</i></h3>
