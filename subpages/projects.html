  Rather it is intended to compliment IRC services. NickServ authentication is recommended, but the ability to auth by the bots own authentication system as well as by hostmask only is available as well.
  This bot has full support for inspircd and charybdis as well as atheme and shalture services. Partial support is available for unrealircd and anope services. Forks of any of these <i> may or may not work. </i>.
