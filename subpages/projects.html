WaveTact is an IRC bot built upon the <a href="https://github.com/TheLQ/pircbotx">PircBotX</a> framework. This bot is intended as an all-in-one utility bot, but <b>NOT</b> a replacement for IRC services.
  Rather it is intended to compliment IRC services. NickServ authentication is recommended, but the ability to auth by the bots own authentication system as well as by nick only is available as well.
  This bot has built-in support for inspircd, unrealircd and charybdis as well as anope and atheme services. Forks of any of these <i> should </i> work but is not guaranteed.

  WaveSite is built upon <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/">Polymer</a> and intended to be as simplistic as possible.
