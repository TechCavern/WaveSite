            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> We were originally a tech blog for posting tech news, but after a long hiatus, Julian Zhou (Our Founder and Lead Developer), shifted gears, given the site wasn't exactly what one would call successful. </p>

            <h2>About our Founder</h2>
            <p> He trashed all his social media accounts as a very interesting way to start off 2018. Oh and he often likes to sit down and think about his past actions, and where to go from there. </p>
